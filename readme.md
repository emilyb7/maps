ðŸŽ¨ I made this just for fun

If the world is going into [goblin mode](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/14/slobbing-out-and-giving-up-why-are-so-many-people-going-goblin-mode) then this is my goblin code ðŸ˜ˆ. One big file with no tests, no types, and not much structure either.

Thanks to [this person](https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon) for all the free map icons.

Note on the countries: I'm using the catalogue of countries/territories available to me in SVG format. The maintainer of the mapsicon project linked above notes that some countries are omitted for technical reasons. This applies to Palestine, which I would have liked to include. I have further omitted a few island territories whose icons rendered very poorly.
