ðŸŽ¨ I made this just for fun

If the world is going into [goblin mode](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/14/slobbing-out-and-giving-up-why-are-so-many-people-going-goblin-mode) then this is my goblin code ðŸ˜ˆ. One big file with no tests, no types, and not much structure either.

Thanks to [this person](https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon) for all the free map icons.
